    Mentors and Questions: '**1st Mentor Topic:** Finance

      * I''m wondering about other options for pre-seed finance that isn''t friends
      and family and EI/LEO grants, when is the best time to get angel investment,
      how to find the right angels and how to handle valuation/equity at early stage.



      **2nd Mentor Topic:** Sales

      * I''m wondering about how best to sell into pharma, how to build their confidence
      if a small startup, what they look for and pricing.



      **3rd Mentor Topic:** Technical

      * The solution I''m working on is a Saas design tool. I don''t have a software
      background and am looking for a technical software cofounder and realise this
      might be a difficult person to find. I''m thinking about options around other
      ways of getting the MVP, CTO as a service / outsourcing and would like to hear
      experience of paths for this and risks.'

      \ their app on a big marketplace like Microsoft, Salesforce app foundry, or\
      \ Oracle CX primarily for winning our biggest prospect's trust or visibility?\

      \ on marketplaces. \nQ1: How to decide whether to build a particular integration\
      \ fully native vs relying on tools like Zapier? \n\nQ2: Is it ok for a B2B enterprise\
      \ SaaS startup to launch their app on a big marketplace like Microsoft, Salesforce\
      \ app foundry, or Oracle CX primarily for winning our biggest prospect's trust\
      \ or visibility? \n\n3. Are leads the best measurement of success for a B2B\

    1st Mentor Questions: 'I am trying to perform some initial customer discovery.


      How should I go on about interviewing all the stakeholders? What questions do
      I ask at the beginning, middle and end? Do I just ask for an interview through
      emails, call them, text them on Linkedin or just go there in person? How do
      I just approach them?


      The rest of the questions are similar to the one above:


      How to approach restaurant/pubs owners regarding the idea (i.e. places that
      are frequently picked by the users)?


      How to approach big ornazisations like supermarkets regarding the idea (i.e.
      they already implement quiet hours)?


      How to approach NGOs regarding the idea (i.e. they represent people with mental/physical
      disabilities, which could benefit from the idea)?


      How to approch potential users (i.e. restaurant goers, people with hearing impairment,
      workers etc.) regarding the idea?

    Mentors and Questions: '**1st Mentor Topic:** Technical

      * ATU (Atlantic Technical University) will shortly start validating my two Health
      tech products via my first €5,000 EI Innovation Voucher and thereafter IPP (Innovation
      Partnership Programme) funding. How can Dogpatch help?



      **2nd Mentor Topic:** Finance

      * To fund the initial production of my two Health tech products I want to access
      EI PSSF funding. Is this the correct route?



      **3rd Mentor Topic:** Marketing

      * I want to market my two Health tech products online rather than via distributors
      because I understand distributors take too big a cut. Is this correct?'

      and we now need to secure funding sooner than expected. We have a limited number
      of stock that we want to leverage for customer traction. We don't qualify for
      EI's pre seed fund and need to find other options.

    3rd Mentor Questions: We design home EV chargers. Our product has been certified

      of differentiation in the market. We believe we can sell our product significantly
      lower than competitors. However I want to explore if/how this is sustainable
      or if we are shooting ourselves in the foot with this low pricing strategy.

    1st Mentor Questions: Where can I find a suitable techie? Twice I've had a technical
      co-founder, who was only interested in managing a developer I had to hire and
      pay for. Both times the "CTO" did minimal work and certainly not hands-on driving
      the product. I have a functional product, and new customers waiting to onboard,
      but I'm at a technical bottle-neck, unable to onboard them or make product updates.
      Any advice here would be greatly appreciated.

    1st Mentor Questions: It is very hard for me having a clear understanding what
      to prioritise and the cadence requiered for a marketing strategy starting from
      scratch. What are the recommendation in terms of marketing with not a strong
      network within the industry we are launching our product? Is Roadshow worth
      having a look? How can we have a clean and cheap marketing (like no-code for
      dev)?

    1st Mentor Questions: I'm tasked with figuring out a budget for customer success.
      I'd like to do this by finding an LTV of a user for when we plan to monetize
      users in the future. To build features to do this, we need to achieve a critical
      mass in terms of userbase, and so finding this figure will mean I can reverse
      engineer a budget to get us to the point where we can achieve this. Forecasting
      projects like this is something I haven't done before and would love some direction
      with.
