* How do I effectively tap into Ireland's ecosystem of Sustainable Fashion?
How do I perfect my sales pitch to potential clients?



**2nd Mentor Topic:** Marketing
* Our start-up is mainly B2B, but we would like to create a community of end-users interested in sustainable fashion in order to create a better position in the market and show end-consumer interaction to our potential clients (sustainable fashion brands). Any insights on online marketing and communications (such as Instagram) would be very helpful!


**3rd Mentor Topic:** Finance
* At the moment, our start-up is part of Trinity's LaunchBox accelerator program which is where we've received our initial funding. However, looking into the future, we will need funding after summer in order to continue our operations. We are currently developing our MVP, which should be ready mid-August.

I had seen in the UK a girl branded her practice as Accountant_she, with pink outfits and pink themes. She is posting on Instagram daily the main business is accounting firm but now she is getting paid partnership. I am wondering how I should market my firm, with which niche market to break in.

recEI9Z5Bu3Egb4Q6,"Our online platform which aggregates sustainable brands acts as a middle-man between the brands and the consumers. Consumers can shop and checkout directly on our website, but the brands are responsible for pushing out the deliveries and sending the clothes to consumers. In the case of any returns, the consumer would have to send the clothes back to the brand's address. We are not planning on buying clothing stock from the brands.

However, we are wondering if there is a way to streamline the process of delivery and returns so that it is more consistent for the consumer shopping on our platform (warehouse, any logistics advice).

Our business has a chicken and egg problem because we need to onboard as many brands as possible on our website to be of value to consumers, but we also need to show traction from consumers (social media/newsletter signups) to convince the right brands to join our platform. 

- How can we most effectively build up our audience before the launch?
- How should we go about the launch?

","Product, Marketing",Online 1:1,"**1st Mentor Topic:** Product
* Our online platform which aggregates sustainable brands acts as a middle-man between the brands and the consumers. Consumers can shop and checkout directly on our website, but the brands are responsible for pushing out the deliveries and sending the clothes to consumers. In the case of any returns, the consumer would have to send the clothes back to the brand's address. We are not planning on buying clothing stock from the brands.

However, we are wondering if there is a way to streamline the process of delivery and returns so that it is more consistent for the consumer shopping on our platform (warehouse, any logistics advice). 


**2nd Mentor Topic:** Marketing
* We are in the process of developing our MVP and hope to launch by the end of the summer. Our business has a chicken and egg problem because we need to onboard as many brands as possible on our website to be of value to consumers, but we also need to show traction from consumers (social media/newsletter signups) to convince the right brands to join our platform.
