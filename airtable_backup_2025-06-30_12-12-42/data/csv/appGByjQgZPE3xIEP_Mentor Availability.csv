- Question(s): 
```We are in the process of developing our MVP and hope to launch by the end of the summer. Our business has a chicken and egg problem because we need to onboard as many brands as possible on our website to be of value to consumers, but we also need to show traction from consumers (social media/newsletter signups) to convince the right brands to join our platform. ; - How can we most effectively build up our audience before the launch?; - How should we go about the launch?; - Any advice on marketing strategy ```
