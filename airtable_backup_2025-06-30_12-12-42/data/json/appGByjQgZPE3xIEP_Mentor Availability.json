Consumers can shop and checkout directly on our website, but the brands are responsible for pushing out the deliveries and sending the clothes to consumers. In the case of any returns, the consumer would have to send the clothes back to the brand's address. We are not planning on buying clothing stock from the brands.; However, we are wondering if there is a way to streamline the process of delivery and returns so that it is more consistent for the consumer shopping on our platform (warehouse, any logistics advice).  ```\n"

Consumers can shop and checkout directly on our website, but the brands are responsible for pushing out the deliveries and sending the clothes to consumers. In the case of any returns, the consumer would have to send the clothes back to the brand's address. We are not planning on buying clothing stock from the brands.; However, we are wondering if there is a way to streamline the process of delivery and returns so that it is more consistent for the consumer shopping on our platform (warehouse, any logistics advice).  ```\n\n \n## 10:00 AM\n### joe borza from [EnergyElephant](https://energyelephant.com/)\n- Zoom Link: [https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81482944992](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81482944992)\n- Oneliner: Sustainability and energy management platform\n- Mentee: joe borza - Founder\n- Website: [https://energyelephant.com/](https://energyelephant.com/) \n- Product stage: Early product/market fit\n- Revenue: \"Yes, I have paying customers\"\n- Business Model: B2B\n- Question(s): \n```How do we reach more potential customers in the UK who are similar to our existing customers? ```\n\n \n## 10:30 AM - Empty Slot\n \n## 11:00 AM\n### Niamh Faller from [Druid Learning](www.druidlearning.com)\n- Zoom Link: [https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86327634686](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86327634686)\n- Oneliner: A complete digital solution for the publishing industry.\n- Mentee: Niamh Faller - CEO\n- Website: [www.druidlearning.com](www.druidlearning.com) \n- Product stage: Early product/market fit\n- Revenue: \"Yes, I have paying customers\"\n- Business Model: B2B\n- Question(s): \n```I have a live google ads campaign and would like to know how to improve it. ;  ```\n\n \n",
