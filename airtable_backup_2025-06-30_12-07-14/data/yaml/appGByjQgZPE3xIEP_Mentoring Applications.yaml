    Mentors and Questions: '**1st Mentor Topic:** Finance

      * I''m wondering about other options for pre-seed finance that isn''t friends
      and family and EI/LEO grants, when is the best time to get angel investment,
      how to find the right angels and how to handle valuation/equity at early stage.



      **2nd Mentor Topic:** Sales

      * I''m wondering about how best to sell into pharma, how to build their confidence
      if a small startup, what they look for and pricing.



      **3rd Mentor Topic:** Technical

      * The solution I''m working on is a Saas design tool. I don''t have a software
      background and am looking for a technical software cofounder and realise this
      might be a difficult person to find. I''m thinking about options around other
      ways of getting the MVP, CTO as a service / outsourcing and would like to hear
      experience of paths for this and risks.'
